<p>Below is a rough sketch of an article to introduce the demo app. WARNING: 
This page is a work in progress and may be significantly out-of-date compared to the current sourcecode.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://simbo1905.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/transaction-log-replication-with-paxos/">posts</a> 
described how the Paxos algorithm can be applied to state replication. This post introduces an embeddable Paxos state 
machine replication engine called TRex. At the heart of TRex is a 
library that has no 3rd party dependencies, other than Scala, which implements the Paxos algorithm as defined by 
the paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf">Paxos Made Simple</a>. 
The library is used by an embeddable consensus server which provides UDP messaging and a durable message store.
The embeddable server comes with a client driver which is cluster aware. The combined solution can be used to build a 
strongly consistent and fault tolerate service by reliably replicate messages, commands or method invocations 
across a cluster of nodes with automatic failover. The demo code for TRex shows how to wrap a simple application 
object so that it is replicated across a cluster of nodes. You can fork the code over at 
<a href="https://github.com/simbo1905/trex">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This post will provide a walk-through of the demo application. A detailed description of how multi-Paxos is implemented in 
TRex is given in a previous post. TRex also comes with extensive unit tests that are an executable specification of its 
implementation of the multi-Paxos consensus algorithm. </p>

<p>Before we begin I should make a statement about the status of the codebase. Currently this post describes version 
x.y.z of the code. Some features that a production replication service would need to provide (e.g. metrics, dynamic 
cluster membership) are not yet implemented. This blog post will be updated as new features are added to TRex. </p>

<p>The demo application implements a key-value store that has the following interface:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-Scala"><pre><span class="pl-k">trait</span> <span class="pl-en">ConsistentKVStore</span> {
<span class="pl-c">  /**</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * Add a value into the KV store</span>
<span class="pl-c">   */</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">put</span>(<span class="pl-v">key</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>, <span class="pl-v">value</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>)<span class="pl-k">:</span> <span class="pl-k">Unit</span>

<span class="pl-c">  /**</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * Add a value into the KV store only if the current version number is 'version'</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * <span class="pl-k">@return</span> True if the operation succeeded else False</span>
<span class="pl-c">   */</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">put</span>(<span class="pl-v">key</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>, <span class="pl-v">value</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>, <span class="pl-v">version</span>: <span class="pl-k">Long</span>)<span class="pl-k">:</span> <span class="pl-k">Boolean</span>

<span class="pl-c">  /**</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * Remove a value form the store.</span>
<span class="pl-c">   */</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">remove</span>(<span class="pl-v">key</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>)<span class="pl-k">:</span> <span class="pl-k">Unit</span>

<span class="pl-c">  /**</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * Remove a value from the KV store only if the current version number is 'version'</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * <span class="pl-k">@return</span></span>
<span class="pl-c">   */</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">remove</span>(<span class="pl-v">key</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>, <span class="pl-v">version</span>: <span class="pl-k">Long</span>)<span class="pl-k">:</span> <span class="pl-k">Boolean</span>

<span class="pl-c">  /**</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * Read a value and its version number from the KV store.</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * <span class="pl-k">@param</span> <span class="pl-v">key</span> The key of the value to get</span>
<span class="pl-c">   * <span class="pl-k">@return</span> A tuple of the value and the version number of the value of the key</span>
<span class="pl-c">   */</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">get</span>(<span class="pl-v">key</span>: <span class="pl-k">String</span>)<span class="pl-k">:</span> <span class="pl-en">Option</span>[(<span class="pl-k">String</span>,<span class="pl-k">Long</span>)]
}</pre></div>

<p>The actual implementation isn't important for the purposes of the demo. It simply represents an application service that we will replicate to achieve fault tolerance. We should note that the write methods are safe to repeat during crash recovery. TRex journals that it has completed chosen commands immediately after they have been run. If a crash happens before the journal is flushed then a command will be rerun after the node is restarted. If your application API is not "recovery replay safe" you should code a custom journal class which participates in your application transactions. You would also need to override the TRex Paxos message sending methods to buffer outbound messages. Either send the buffered massages post-commit else drop them post-rollback. </p>

<p>Now that we understand the object we wish to replicate we can go step-by-step through [the demo code]. It starts with a static TRex cluster configuration:</p>

<pre><code># trex simple cluster configuration
    trex {
    # folder to use to persist data at each node
    data-folder="/tmp"
    # number of slots entries to retain in the log to support retransmission
    data-retained=1048576
    # static cluster definintion
    cluster {
        name = "PaxosKVStore"
        nodes = "101,102,103"
        node-101 {
            host = "192.168.122.11"
            client-port = 43124
            node-port = 43125
        }
        node-102 {
            host = "192.168.122.12"
            client-port = 43124
            node-port = 43125
        }
        node-103 {
            host = "192.168.122.13"
            client-port = 43124
            node-port = 43125
        }
    }
    # timeouts
    leader-timeout-max=4000
    leader-timeout-min=2000
    }
</code></pre>

<p>That defines a TRex cluster with three server nodes on localhost exposing a TCP port to clients and a UDP port to the other cluster nodes. The client application loads the configuration then creates a dynamic proxy backed by the Paxos cluster:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-Scala"><pre>    <span class="pl-k">val</span> <span class="pl-en">cluster</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Cluster</span>.parseConfig(config)

    <span class="pl-k">val</span> <span class="pl-en">system</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span>
      <span class="pl-en">ActorSystem</span>(cluster.name, <span class="pl-en">ConfigFactory</span>.load(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>client.conf<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>))

    <span class="pl-k">val</span> <span class="pl-en">timeout</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Timeout</span>(<span class="pl-c1">100</span> millisecond)

    <span class="pl-k">val</span> <span class="pl-en">driver</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> system.actorOf(<span class="pl-en">Props</span>(<span class="pl-c1">classOf</span>[<span class="pl-en">StaticClusterDriver</span>], timeout, cluster, <span class="pl-c1">20</span>), <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>TrexDriver<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)

    <span class="pl-k">val</span> <span class="pl-en">typedActor</span><span class="pl-k">:</span> <span class="pl-en">ConsistentKVStore</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span>
      <span class="pl-en">TypedActor</span>(system).
        typedActorOf(
          <span class="pl-en">TypedProps</span>[<span class="pl-en">ConsistentKVStore</span>],
          driver)</pre></div>

<p>That code creates a TRex client driver passing in the cluster configuration. It then creates a TypedActor proxy which forwards onto the TRex driver. The TypedActor proxy pattern is an out-of-the-box Akka feature used to bridge application code into the ActorSystem. It gives us an implementation of the application interface which serialises every method invocation as a MethodCall message. The TRex driver then transmits the MethodCall messages over the network to the current Paxos distinguished leader. We should note that the TRex driver it is agnostic to the client-to-server application protocol. You can even configure Akka with a custom serialiser to control the wire format. If you are already using Akka you could forgo using the TypedActor and send your application messages directly to the driver.  </p>

<p>That's it. The remainder of the client application is a trivial loop reading input commands to invoke methods on the interface. The same loop would work invoking methods directly on a local object. We can think of the few lines of Akka code shown above as a drop-in replacement for a local object. The drop-in code creates a stub of the application which is a dynamic proxy backed by a cluster of replicated objects with automatic failover. Next we need to setup the server cluster. </p>

<p>The server code is as follows:  </p>

<div class="highlight highlight-Scala"><pre>      <span class="pl-c">// the client app K-V store</span>

<p>There is quite a bit going on there due to the separation of concerns in the code. The application object <code>val clientApp = new MapDBConsistentKVStore(db))</code> has its own concerns and has no dependencies on TRex. The journal object encapsulates the concern of journaling the progress of the consensus algorithm. As noted above an application which is not crash recovery replay safe would need to provide a custom journal that participates in application transactions. The <code>TypedActorPaxosEndpoint</code> is our Trex Server which runs the consensus algorithm.</p>

<p>The most interesting actor for the purpose of a demo of integrating TRex into an existing application is the <code>TypedActorPaxosEndpoint</code>. This runs the consensus algorithm over values sent from the TRex driver by clients. In this case the values are <code>MethodCall</code> messages sent from the <code>TypedActor</code> at the client. This endpoint reflectively invokes the select commands on its local copy of the replicated application object. The consensus logic is in a superclass so you can write a custom endpoint actor by overriding the <code>deliver</code> method. You can then compile the deliver logic directly against your own application code and message formats. </p>

<p>Now we have both client and server its worth describing the full data flow created by the demo code. The client code invokes the interface methods on the <code>TypedActor</code>. The <code>TypedActor</code> forwards a <code>MethodCall</code> message to the TRex driver. The driver has Akka serialise the message and forwards it to the distinguished leader over TCP. At the other end the distinguished leader runs the multi-Paxos consensus algorithm over UDP. The chosen messages are invoked on all the replicated objects in consensus order. The method return value at the distinguished leader is sent back to the client TRex driver. It responds to the TypedActor which competes the method call for the client code. </p>

<p>We can now start up the three server process and multiple clients. We can run commands though the clients and kill the leader node to see a failover. If we restart the failed node it will automatically sync up with the new leader. Not bad for a few lines of custom code and a bit of configuration. </p>
